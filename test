here’s a crisp task breakdown you can drop straight into your sprint board. I included all four tasks you described (you initially said three, but you specified a fourth—so I captured it, too).

Task 1 — Build “Annotation Report Template” function

Goal: Generate a base Validation Report from (a) the model document (source), (b) the question template DOCX, and (c) a CSV mapping (sections → questions).

Deliverable / API:

Function: run_pipeline(source_docx, template_docx, mapping_csv, out_name=None) -> str

Output: a DOCX with:

Pre-built Table of Contents

All sections and subsections from the template

All tables present in the template

Modeling Team Response (MTR) blocks inserted with empty placeholders



Acceptance Criteria:

Given valid inputs, the function produces a DOCX without errors.

TOC appears at the top and updates correctly (fields refresh on open).

Every template question is placed under the correct heading.

MTR placeholders exist for every test question and are empty.

All template tables are preserved (structure, merged cells, widths).

The function returns the output path and the file opens in Word without repair prompts.

Task 2 — Append “Finding Details” section with Challenge, MTR, MRMG Assessment

Goal: In a single section titled “Finding Details”, append each finding with:

Challenge (problem statement),

Modeling Team Response (specific to the finding),

MRMG Assessment (review/assessment text).


Inputs:

A dataframe (or CSV) with at least: Finding Details, Challenge, Modeling_Team_Response, MRMG_Assessment (column names can be mapped).


Acceptance Criteria:

A top-level “Finding Details” section is present (exact text).

For each finding row, a clearly separated block is added with subheadings:

“Challenge”

“Modeling Team Response”

“MRMG Assessment”


Order of findings matches input order.

No content from this task leaks into S1/S2 per-tag sections.

Formatting is consistent: headings bold, body normal, spacing uniform (no orphan bullets/lines).

If a field is missing/blank, a placeholder “—” is inserted (no crashes).



---

Task 3 — Generate MRMG Responses for all Test Questions (post-MTR), with Findings/RFR mentions

Goal: For every test question in the report, add an MRMG Response subsection after the corresponding Modeling Team Response, and explicitly mention linked Findings and/or RFR items if present.

Inputs:

Questions list (from Task 1 result)

Optional mappings: question → related findings / RFR ids (from CSV/DF)


Acceptance Criteria:

For each question block:

Order is Question → MTR → MRMG Response.

If associated finding(s) exist, MRMG Response contains a bullet “Related Findings: …”.

If associated RFR(s) exist, MRMG Response contains a bullet “Related RFR: …”.


Where no associations exist, MRMG Response still appears with placeholder text ready for authoring.

No duplication of MRMG Response blocks.

Cross-references (IDs/titles) match input mapping.



---

Task 4 — Heading Numbering & Text Reformatting (Finalize Document)

Goal: Normalize heading numbering, text formatting, and overall document style, producing the final, submission-ready Validation Report.

Scope:

Ensure all headings carry the correct number (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.1.1) consistent with the template hierarchy.

Reformat text (fonts, sizes, spacing, list levels) to template styles.

Preserve figure/table captions; do not renumber model tables beyond template rules.


Acceptance Criteria:

All headings display correct numbers and levels, consistent across the doc.

Body text adheres to template styles (font family/size, line spacing, paragraph spacing).

Lists render correctly (no broken numbering, no mixed bullet styles).

TOC regenerates with correct page numbers and heading labels.

No style regressions in tables (column widths, merged cells intact).

The final DOCX opens without repair prompts and passes a quick manual scan for layout issues (no overflow beyond page margins).

Notes & Dependencies

T2 depends on the base doc from T1.

T3 depends on the structured sections/questions from T1 and any mapping to findings/RFR.

T4 runs last to unify numbering/styles across all injected content.

Consider adding small CLI wrappers for each task for pipeline CI runs.


If you want, I can also turn these into Jira tickets with concise descriptions and checklists.
