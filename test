    """You will be given a query and a set of nodes and edges in the form of lists. 
Your task is to generate an accurate and concise answer to the query using the provided information.

Use the following components to inform your answer:

- Tree structure of nodes: {selected_tree}  
- Pre-order traversal nodes: {selected_preorder_nodes}  
- Post-order traversal nodes: {selected_postorder_nodes}  
- Labeled edges with direction: {selected_labeled_edges}  
- Dictionary of triples with IDs: {triplate_dict}

Query:
{query}

Output:
1. Final answer to the query using the above nodes and edges.
2. A filtered/pruned version of the `triplate_dict` that includes only the entries used in answer generation.
