Sure! Here's a clearer and more professional rephrasing of your message:

Hi,
Currently, we are using an auto-merger method for chunking, where a large parent chunk is created first, and then smaller child chunks are derived from it — essentially a hierarchical chunking approach.

However, during evaluation, we observed that some chunks are getting split incorrectly in the middle, which impacts content coherence.

To address this, we are now planning to move to a section-wise chunking strategy. In this new approach:

Each section will be treated as a single chunk.

If a section is too large, we will further split it while keeping the full content — including tables and images — intact within each subdivided chunk.

Let me know if you'd like this in a more technical tone or simplified further.
