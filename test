Sure! Here's a clearer and more structured rephrasing of your statement:


---

We updated the AutoMerger logic by integrating the NLTK sentence splitter and introduced a dynamic chunking strategy. This ensures that each section, heading, and subheading remains grouped together within the same parent chunk.

If the parent chunk length is less than 1000 characters, we retain it as a single chunk (no further splitting).

If it's greater than 1000, we apply a ratio-based splitting using the proportions [4:2:1] to divide the content into smaller subchunks.


This approach improves coherence and preserves logical grouping of content while ensuring optimal chunk size for downstream processing.
