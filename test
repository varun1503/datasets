Hereâ€™s a rephrased and polished version of your update points for a one-pager or to present in your scrum meeting:


---

Work Progress Update

1. Modular Notebook Design

Structured the Jupyter notebook into modular components to separate concerns between services and API integrations, ensuring better maintainability and scalability.



2. Document Parsing Service

Developed a robust parsing service to process Word documents (.docx), extracting content and converting it into chunks suitable for downstream ingestion.



3. FastAPI Integration for Automation

Built FastAPI endpoints to automate the parsing and ingestion workflow. The API accepts a filename, triggers the parsing service, uploads files to S3, and inserts the processed data into Datastax.



4. Code Refactoring & Metadata Enhancement

Refactored parsing logic to improve performance and readability.

Added a preprocessing layer to enrich metadata and chunk content with additional contextual information before ingestion.
