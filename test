Got it! Hereâ€™s the revised and clearer version of your task list with point 7 corrected:

1. Enhance the recipe CLI code by adding three new recipes:

langgraph

knowledgegraph

advanced_rag



2. Extend the advanced_rag recipe to include a new chunking method: semantic chunking.


3. Convert the knowledgegraph notebook into Python scripts to retrieve data from a .gpickle file.


4. Create a script for generating a knowledge graph from PDF files.


5. Develop a UI for all three recipes, incorporating features as per the requirements.


6. Test and debug the codebase, ensuring functionality, and push the finalized code to Git.


7. Create a script to upload knowledge graph triples into DataStax (without changing their format).



Would you like me to help scaffold or write code for any specific point on this list?
