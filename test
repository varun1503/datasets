Here’s a structured approach to creating a visually appealing one-slider in Word for your task. The goal is to present the work in a concise, professional, and engaging way. Here's how you can structure it:


---

One-Slider Design for Text Model Package Creation

Title:

"Streamlining Text Model Package Creation and Deployment for MDK"


---

Key Objectives:

1. Package Availability in Artifactory:

Developed setup.py for seamless packaging of the text model.



2. Testing Framework:

Local testing performed using GoldML and additional environments.



3. Automated Testing:

Created robust pytest cases to validate the pipeline.



4. Continuous Deployment:

Integrated pipeline with Jenkins for automated deployment to Artifactory.





---

Work Completed:


---

Visual Flow of the Workflow:

(Add a diagram or flowchart)

Text Model Development → Local Testing → Unit Testing (pytest) → Jenkins Deployment → Artifactory



---

Achievements:

Created a streamlined pipeline for text model deployment.

Ensured reliability through automated testing and CI/CD integration.

Optimized the process for faster deployment cycles.



---

Closing Note:

This work sets a precedent for efficient and scalable package management in the MDK ecosystem.

To make it visually AWESOME, include:

1. Icons or images for tools (Python, Jenkins, Pytest, Artifactory).


2. Professional font styles (e.g., Calibri or Arial).


3. Use color coding (e.g., green for success, blue for progress).


4. A visually appealing diagram (e.g., workflow or task completion timeline).
