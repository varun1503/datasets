The image appears to be a screenshot of a presentation slide discussing user interfaces for a SQL generation tool called Gleam. Here are the key details about Screen 1 as shown in the image:

Screen 1 Details:

It is the opening page where the user can ask questions related to SQL generation after logging in.

The interface displays:

A sidebar on the left with options:

SQL Generation

Configuration


A welcome message: "Welcome to Gleam!"

A text input field at the bottom with a prompt: "Ask follow-up questions..."



Screen 2 (Partially Visible) Details:

After a user asks a question and gets a response, the system asks the user to verify the response.


The screenshot also indicates that Varun Vaishy is talking in a meeting, with 2 people in the huddle, and there is an option to stop sharing the screen.

Screen 3 Details:

This screen is part of the Gleam SQL Generation Configuration process, where the system asks the user to select tables and columns from the schema.

Key Elements on the Screen:

1. User Query & Refinement:

The system has identified a query that retrieves the obligor ID and obligor name for obligors with a rating of B-.

It also asks for the current card utilization, calculated using the average of the last 3 or 12 months.

The text is highlighted in gray, with an option for the user to confirm or refine it:

"Yes, I mean this" (blue button)

"No, I mean something else" (red button)




2. Table Selection Section:

Users can review and adjust the automatically selected tables and columns.

Dropdown menus allow the user to select tables:

Selected Tables: Cornerstone

Selected Tables: CRU




3. User Confirmation:

After adjusting the table selection, the user can confirm their selection.




Purpose of This Screen:

This step ensures that the correct database tables are chosen to generate an SQL query that meets the user's intent. The interface provides a way to refine the query and customize the selection before proceeding.
