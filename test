Comparing two BERT embeddings:

If you plot both embeddings on the same KDE graph, the curves will help visualize how similar or different the distributions of values are.
Similar KDE curves → The two embeddings have similar distributions of values.
Different KDE curves → The embeddings' distributions differ, which might indicate dissimilarity between the embeddings.
Interpretation of the KDE Plot:

If the BERT embeddings represent similar inputs (e.g., two similar sentences), their KDE plots should be close, as BERT would produce similar high-dimensional representations.
For embeddings of dissimilar inputs (e.g., unrelated sentences), the KDE plots will likely show a significant difference in density distributions.

# Example Embeddings
embedding1 = np.random.rand(100, 768)  # Simulated 100x768-dimensional vector
embedding2 = np.random.rand(100, 768)  # Another 100x768-dimensional vector

# Combine embeddings
combined_embeddings = np.vstack((embedding1, embedding2))
labels = ['Embedding 1'] * 100 + ['Embedding 2'] * 100  # Labels for differentiation

# Reduce dimensionality with UMAP

embeddings_2d = reducer.fit_transform(combined_embeddings)
