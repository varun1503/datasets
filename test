Key Features of Evidently AI
1. Data Drift Detection
Compares the distribution of features in the training (reference) and current (production) datasets.
Uses statistical tests like Wasserstein Distance and Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test to quantify drift.
Reports metrics and visualizations for feature-wise drift detection.
2. Target Drift Detection
Monitors changes in the target variable's distribution.
Useful for classification tasks where class distributions may change over time.
3. Model Performance Monitoring
Tracks performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score over time.
Detects performance degradation caused by data or concept drift.
4. Data Quality Monitoring
Checks for anomalies such as missing values, duplicate rows, and outliers.
Tracks statistics like feature mean, variance, and standard deviation.
5. Feature Correlation Analysis
Monitors the correlation between features and the target variable.
Identifies unexpected changes in feature importance or relationships.
