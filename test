PRUNE_KG_QUADRUPLES_PROMPT = """
You are a financial knowledge graph cleaner. Your task is to identify and **prune weak or redundant quadruples** from a dictionary where each key represents a child node ID and its value is a list of quadruples.

Each quadruple follows the format:
(Theme, Subject, Predicate, Object)

You must keep only those quadruples that:
1. Add meaningful insights into financial performance, risk, or strategy.
2. Are not vague, overly generic, or semantically duplicate.
3. Offer quantifiable, directional, or strategic signals.

If two quadruples communicate similar meaning (e.g. one general and one more specific), prefer the more specific one.

---

Here is your input dictionary of child nodes and their quadruples:

{input_quadruples_dict}

---

Output a new dictionary with **pruned** quadruples per child node ID, using the same format.

Only return the pruned dictionary. Do not add explanation.
