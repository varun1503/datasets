Absolutely! Here's a balanced version with a mix of "I" statements and varied phrasing to make it feel natural and personal:

✅ Sprint Accomplishments – Parsing & Ingestion

I enhanced the parsing service to support Word document ingestion, including handling of tables and image captions.

Created and tested logic for parsing merged tables across multiple document formats.

Integrated the new parsing capabilities with the DataLoader and connected them to the API for S3-based ingestion.

I added functionality to extract styling information (font, size, boldness, etc.) for each word and included these details in the CSV output.

Refactored the chunking logic to support a no-chunking mode and upgraded the AutoMergeChunker to use the NLTK splitter for more natural segmentation.

I ensured the final output is consistently formatted into CSV, making it ready for ingestion into the DataStax API.
