Here’s a user story–style one-pager for your E2 Readiness and Pipeline Validation, with a clear story heading, description, and acceptance criteria — ideal for sprint documentation or Jira entry.

Story Title:

E2 Readiness – Validation and Testing of End-to-End Data Ingestion Pipeline (Chunking, Embedding, and Ingestion Services)


---

Description:

The goal of this story is to ensure full E2 readiness for the data ingestion pipeline, validating its functionality, stability, and integration across environments. The pipeline comprises three major services — Chunking, Embedding, and Ingestion — which together form the backbone of the MRMG document processing and vector storage system.

The team conducted E1 environment testing to verify service-level functionality, API responsiveness, and internal data flow between components. Each service was deployed, tested, and monitored for errors, latency, and schema compatibility. After successful validation in E1, the focus shifted to E2 readiness, where environment configurations, credentials, Kafka topic connectivity, and DataStax vector database endpoints were validated for production-like stability.

The E2 readiness phase confirmed that all three services — Chunking, Embedding, and Ingestion — can seamlessly operate together as a unified system, handling document ingestion from source to vector index. This ensures the pipeline is deployment-ready for E2, capable of supporting MRMG use cases with full observability, logging, and error recovery in place.

Acceptance Criteria:

✅ Chunking Service successfully processes and splits uploaded documents into structured chunks with metadata enrichment.

✅ Embedding Service generates embeddings using the configured model (e.g., GPT-4o embeddings) and pushes them to the ingestion pipeline without failures.

✅ Ingestion Service ingests the processed embeddings and metadata into DataStax vector tables, maintaining correct schema alignment.

✅ Kafka topics for chunking, embedding, and ingestion are connected, authenticated, and consuming messages end-to-end without error.

✅ Environment variables and secrets are configured correctly in E2 (AuthBlue, AiDa FeatureOps, DataStax endpoints, etc.).

✅ API endpoints for all services return valid responses with 200 OK in E2.

✅ Logs confirm full message flow from document upload to vector ingestion with no broken stages.

✅ E1 testing validated integration behavior; E2 readiness confirms stability, scalability, and data accuracy across services.

Would you like me to extend this with a “Testing Summary” section (e.g., tools used, results, latency benchmarks, and sample logs) for sprint documentation or demo notes?
