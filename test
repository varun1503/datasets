Step 1: Cluster BERT Embeddings
Perform clustering on the embeddings.
Select samples evenly across clusters.

Step 2: Stratified Sampling by Labels
Ensure equal representation of labels in the sampled data

Step 3: Measure Cosine Similarity for Token Balance
Compute pairwise cosine similarity within and across labels to select diverse embeddings.

Step 4: Combine Clustering and Stratification
Combine clustering and label-based stratification to ensure both diversity and balance.

Data Preprocessing for Text Quality
Key Methods:
Text Cleaning:

Lowercasing, removing punctuation, and handling special characters.
Removing stopwords and stemming/lemmatization.
Outlier Detection:

Detect unusually short or long text samples.
Identify embeddings with abnormal distance metrics (e.g., high cosine similarity to unrelated samples).
Check for Corrupt Text:

Detect null or incomplete entries.
Flag entries with unprintable characters.
Steps for Detecting Corrupt Text
Detect Null or Empty Entries:
Identify rows where the text is missing (null or empty strings).
Flag Incomplete Entries:
Identify text that is unusually short or doesn't meet expected criteria (e.g., missing tokens).
Unprintable Characters:
Detect text with unprintable or non-ASCII characters.
