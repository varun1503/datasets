Description

Develop a parsing and indexing pipeline that processes RFR and Finding documents. The pipeline should include enhanced methods for document parsing, metadata extraction, and indexing services. These services must be fully integrated to support ingestion into DataStax, ensuring scalability, accuracy, and consistency across all document types.

Acceptance Criteria

The system can successfully parse RFR and Finding documents.

Extracted data (including content and metadata) is validated for accuracy and completeness.

Indexed data is stored in DataStax with proper schema alignment.

End-to-end integration from document ingestion to DataStax indexing works without errors.

Logs and error handling are implemented for traceability and deh"ning.
