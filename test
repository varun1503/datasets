Here’s a crisp one-pager for your sprint review that captures all three tasks in a concise, professional way:


---

Sprint Review – One Pager

Objective

Enhance the Validation Report pipeline by integrating RFRs, findings, static tables, and structural elements (cover page, TOC) to ensure completeness and compliance.


---

Key Tasks Completed

1. RFR & Findings Integration

Incorporated RFR questions and findings into the annotated validation report.

Linked IMBP questions → Findings → RFRs within each section.



2. Static Table Inclusion

Added a predefined fixed table from the pretend Word document into the validation report template.

Ensured seamless formatting and proper placement.



3. Cover Page, TOC & Findings Table

Created cover page with model ID, model description, and validation date.

Added dynamic table of contents with headings and subheadings.

Appended pretend doc, findings table, and RFR findings for a complete report package.





---

Outcome

Validation report now has end-to-end completeness: RFRs, findings, fixed tables, TOC, and cover page integrated.

Ready for downstream ingestion and review.

Do you want me to also make this visually styled in tabular format (like a summary table with columns: Task – Description – Outcome) so it looks more polished for the sprint deck?
