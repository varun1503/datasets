Currently, we are utilizing Optuna exclusively for performing hyperparameter tuning (HPT) on the BERT model. A configuration file (config.yml) is used to define the search space, along with data and model-related configurations, as outlined earlier. The accompanying MDK chart illustrates this process.

After tuning the text model using HPT, several artifacts are generated, including test dataset results, model checkpoints (best model), and plots. The supported features are summarized in the table above.

As depicted in the diagram, we evaluated multiple options for HPT, with the details of our findings presented in the table below.
