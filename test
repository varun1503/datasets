Implement in Notebook – Develop and visualize drift detection using IF (Isolation Forest), IDF (Inverse Document Frequency), and BERT embeddings.
Integrate Drift Detection Utility – Combine drift detection with Hyperparameter Tuning (HPT) and Mutual Information (MI) for text models.
Write Pytest Cases – Implement unit tests for HPT, MI, and drift detection.
Set Up Jenkins Pipeline – Automate the process for pushing the package to Artifactory.
Review & Enhance Drift Detection – Improve the drift detection framework with additional text-based features.
Present Demo of MDK Package – Showcase the capabilities and functionalities of the package.
Refine HPT & Drift Based on Feedback – Incorporate recommended improvements to HPT and drift detection.
Update Package & Test on GCP – Deploy the updated package and validate its performance in a GCP environment.
