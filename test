Below are three well-defined tasks for the Case Assist Playbook, followed by a one-pager summary covering scope, outcomes, and deliverables.
This is written at EA / Technical Architecture rigor (L3) and is suitable for CTO review and sprint planning.


---

Task 1: Technical Architecture – Level 3 (L3)

Objective

Define the Level 3 Technical Architecture for the Case Assist system, covering component interactions, technology choices, deployment topology, and non-functional considerations.

Scope

Logical and physical architecture

Service decomposition

Deployment and runtime view

Security and compliance alignment

Scalability and availability strategy


Key Activities

Identify all system components:

UI (Frontend)

API Gateway

Orchestration Layer (LangGraph)

Retrieval & Indexing Services

LLM Inference Layer

Data Stores (Vector DB, Metadata DB, Object Storage)


Define inter-service communication (REST / async events)

Map technology stack per layer

Define environments (Dev / QA / Prod)

Document non-functional requirements:

Latency

Throughput

Fault tolerance

Observability



Deliverables

L3 Technical Architecture Diagram

Component responsibility matrix

Technology stack mapping

Deployment topology diagram

NFR mapping to architecture decisions


Acceptance Criteria

Architecture aligns with EA standards

Clear separation of concerns

Supports future extensibility (new models, retrievers)

Approved by Architecture Review Board / CTO



---

Task 2: Data Flow & Sequence Diagrams (System Interaction Design)

Objective

Create end-to-end data flow diagrams (DFD) and sequence diagrams that explain how data and control move through Case Assist for each major use case.

Scope

Ingestion flow

Query & retrieval flow

LLM answer generation flow

Error and retry handling flow


Key Activities

Identify core use cases:

Document ingestion

Index creation

User query execution

Answer generation with citations


Define data inputs, outputs, and transformations

Create sequence diagrams showing:

Actor → UI → API → Orchestrator → Services


Create DFDs showing:

Persistent vs transient data

Data stores involved at each step



Deliverables

High-level Data Flow Diagram

Detailed Sequence Diagrams:

Ingestion sequence

Query → Retrieval → Generation sequence


Data ownership and lifecycle documentation


Acceptance Criteria

Diagrams are consistent with L3 architecture

Every API call and data store interaction is traceable

Error paths are explicitly documented



---

Task 3: Detailed Design – Component, Infrastructure & API Reference

Objective

Produce a Detailed Design Document (DDD) covering component-level design, full-stack infrastructure, and API specifications.

Scope

Component-Level Design

UI components (Chat, Upload, Settings)

Backend services

LangGraph nodes and transitions

Custom retrievers and chunkers

Security and auth components


Infrastructure Design

Cloud resources

Networking

Compute and storage

CI/CD and secrets management

Observability stack


API Reference

REST endpoints

Request/response schemas

Error codes

Authentication and authorization


Key Activities

Define class and module responsibilities

Define interfaces between components

Design infra using IaC mindset

Document APIs using OpenAPI-style structure

Map APIs to sequence diagrams


Deliverables

Detailed Component Design document

Infrastructure Architecture & resource mapping

API Reference (detailed endpoint-level documentation)

Security and access control design


Acceptance Criteria

Design is implementation-ready

APIs are unambiguous and testable

Infrastructure supports scale and HA

Security controls meet enterprise standards



---

One-Pager: Case Assist – Architecture & Design Workstream

Purpose

Establish a clear, enterprise-grade architecture and design foundation for the Case Assist platform to enable scalable, secure, and maintainable GenAI capabilities.

In Scope

L3 Technical Architecture

Data Flow & Sequence Diagrams

Detailed Component & Infrastructure Design

Full API Reference


Out of Scope

UI visual design

Model training and fine-tuning

Business process documentation


Key Outcomes

Clear system blueprint for developers

Reduced implementation ambiguity

Faster onboarding for new engineers

Strong alignment with EA and CTO expectations


Deliverables Summary

Area	Output

Architecture	L3 Technical Architecture
Interaction	DFD & Sequence Diagrams
Design	Component, Infra, API Specs
Governance	Security & NFR alignment


Stakeholders

Engineering Team

EA / Architecture Review Board

CTO Office

Platform & DevOps Teams


Success Criteria

CTO approval without major rework

Design reused directly in implementation

Architecture supports future GenAI expansion
