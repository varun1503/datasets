Here are polished, professional, and polite versions suitable for feedback to a Senior Manager:


---

✅ What would you like this leader to keep doing?

“Continue providing strong leadership and fostering a healthy, supportive work culture. Your guidance and clarity help the team stay aligned and motivated.”


---

✅ What could this leader do differently to be more effective?

“Placing additional focus on managing client expectations and timelines would be helpful. Having a dedicated technical lead to handle unexpected client requirements could reduce pressure on the team and allow us to concentrate more on our core responsibilities.”

If you want it even more formal or want multiple versions, I can refine further!
