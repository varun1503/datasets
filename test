lass Imbalance
Balanced Classes: Each label has a similar proportion of samples (e.g., 33%, 33%, 34% for three classes).
Imbalanced Classes: Use resampling techniques:
Oversampling: Duplicate samples in minority classes.
Undersampling: Remove samples from majority classes.
Hybrid Sampling: Combine oversampling and undersampling.
Embedding Feature Distribution
Uniform Distributions: Variances across dimensions and classes are consistent.
Skewed Distributions: If variances differ significantly across classes or dimensions:
Dimensional Normalization: Standardize embeddings (e.g., z-score normalization).
Feature Selection: Remove noisy or redundant dimensions.
