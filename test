Sprint One-Pager – MRMG Annotation Improvements

Sprint Goal

Enhance the MRMG annotation pipeline by fixing existing issues, improving RFR-based data extraction, and validating newly deployed modules to ensure accurate findings generation and seamless workflow execution.


---

Key Deliverables

1. Annotation Report Bug Fixes

Resolved issues in the annotation report module that were causing incorrect or incomplete results in the finding section.

Improved stability and correctness of the annotation generation pipeline.


2. RFR Data Extraction Enhancements

Developed new methods for RFR (Request For Review) data extraction based on IMTP questions and mapped finding details.

Ensured extracted data is correctly formatted and aligned with downstream requirements (e.g., Finding Excel sheet generation).


3. Deployed Code Validation

Executed end-to-end testing on the newly deployed version of the annotation pipeline.

Verified all edge cases, cross-checked functionality, and confirmed consistency with expected outputs.



---

Outcome

Improved accuracy and reliability of the MRMG annotation workflow.

Faster, structured, and more accurate RFR-to-finding mapping.

Ensured smooth deployment with validated functionality, reducing manual intervention and error rate.
