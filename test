Token Frequency Balancing
Analyze token distributions across labels and balance the frequency of tokens in your sample.
Key Metrics:

Term Frequency (TF): Number of times a token appears in a document.
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Weight tokens that are rare in the corpus.

Clustering with Token Frequency Considerations
Perform clustering on embeddings and adjust cluster size weights using token frequency.
