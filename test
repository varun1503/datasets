Here are one-pager style summaries for each task, with 3 crisp points each 👇


---

Task 1: Analyzing the report format and start configuring the output format

Reviewed existing MRMG / validation report structure to understand required sections, tags, and ordering.

Identified standard patterns for headings, RFR blocks, modeling team responses, and follow-ups.

Defined the baseline output schema to ensure consistency and reusability across reports.



---

Task 2: Format the RFR and follow-up questions, add Modeling Team response, and align format with multiple corner cases

Standardized RFR, follow-up, and Modeling Team Response formatting with clear tag boundaries (< >).

Handled variations such as inline responses, bracketed responses ([modelling team response]), and multiline cases.

Ensured robustness across edge cases without altering original content order or semantics.



---

Task 3: Test the updated code and formatting

Validated output against multiple real MRMG examples to ensure format accuracy.

Tested edge cases to confirm no regression in tagging, ordering, or content loss.

Finalized formatting logic to be production-ready and aligned with review expectations.
