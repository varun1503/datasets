Subject: Leave Request for Family Trip

Hi Manoj,

Hope you're doing well.

My parents are planning a small family trip at the end of this month, and it’s been a long time since we’ve all come together. I’d like to request 3 days of vacation to join them.

I will ensure that all my tasks are completed before I leave and there will be no impact on ongoing work.

Let me know if you need any additional details.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
