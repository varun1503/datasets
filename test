Subject: Request to Work from Home on Specific Dates

Dear [Manager's Name],

As discussed, I would like to request to work from home over the next two weeks due to some personal reasons where I need family support. I will be working from home on the following dates:

September 15, 17, 22, and 24

Please let me know if this works, or if any adjustments are needed.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards, Varun
