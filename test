Below is a clean one-page document covering the tasks shown in your Rally board, written in a formal EA / delivery-ready format.
This can be directly added to your EA Playbook, Rally description, or shared with CTO / stakeholders.

Case Assist – Annotation, Structuring & Validation One-Pager

Objective

Deliver a stable, structured, and validated Case Assist report processing pipeline by implementing arrival-based annotation extraction, table and figure restructuring, event environment deployment, and final validation cleanup.


---

Scope of Work

1. RFR & Finding Report Annotation Extraction

Enhance and modify the RFR and finding extraction logic as per the latest document structure.

Ensure annotations (sections, findings, references) are correctly parsed and ordered.

Align extraction output with updated report standards.



---

2. Table & Figure Restructuring and Deployment

Implement robust table and figure structuring logic.

Maintain correct hierarchy, captions, and parent–child relationships.

Deploy the updated structuring logic into the event environment.

Validate accuracy using real report samples.



---

3. Test in Event Environment & Bug Fixes

Perform end-to-end testing in the event environment.

Identify and fix defects related to:

Annotation mismatches

Structural inconsistencies

Processing failures


Ensure pipeline stability across multiple runs.



---

4. Final Validation Cleanup – Unnecessary Tag Removal

Identify unnecessary or noisy tags present in the final validation report.

Remove irrelevant tags from the modeling response without impacting semantic meaning.

Ensure final validation output is clean, minimal, and production-ready.



---

Key Deliverables

Updated annotation extraction logic

Structured table and figure outputs

Deployed and tested event-based pipeline

Clean final validation reports with unnecessary tags removed



---

Success Criteria

Arrival-triggered processing works reliably

Annotations, tables, and figures are correctly structured

Event environment execution is stable

Final validation reports contain no redundant or unnecessary tags



---

Dependencies

Availability of updated report formats

Event environment readiness

Access to validation and test datasets
