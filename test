Hi @nbose and @Manoj Kumar,

After our call, @nbose and I discussed further and concluded that we will store the quadruples in the body blob, and the text content in the metadata.

For example, from a single file, around 800 chunks were generated, resulting in approximately 2900 quadruples. I've embedded those 2900 quadruples and inserted them into the table.

I'm currently working on the retrieval part.
