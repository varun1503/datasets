Ah, got it! You want to avoid starting every bullet point with “I” and make the phrasing more varied and natural while still keeping it in first person. Here’s a refined version with that in mind:

✅ Sprint Accomplishments – Parsing & Ingestion

Enhanced the parsing service to support ingestion of Word documents with proper handling of tables and image captions.

Built logic to accurately parse merged tables and validated the functionality across multiple document formats.

Took care of integrating these enhancements into the DataLoader and updated the API to enable ingestion via S3.

Added functionality to extract word-level styling (font, size, boldness, etc.) and tagged each chunk accordingly in the CSV output.

Refactored the chunking logic to introduce a "no-chunking" mode and improved the AutoMergeChunker by integrating the NLTK splitter for more natural breaks.

Made sure the final parsed data is properly structured into CSV format for smooth ingestion into the DataStax API.
