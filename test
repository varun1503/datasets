# Session Management Service

## Overview
The **Session Management Service** is an API that allows users to interact with an LLM-powered application.  
It supports the **MRMG** use case, enabling users to:
- Upload model files to S3 for validation.
- Trigger Kafka-based processing for document chunking.
- View session history and perform additional actions.

# Session Management Service – MRMG Ingestion Step 1

## Overview
The **Session Management Service** is the **first step** in the **MRMG ingestion pipeline**.  
It is responsible for:
1. Uploading model/document files to S3.
2. Invoking Kafka to send processing messages to the **chunking topic**.
3. Initiating the document chunking process.

Once chunking completes, the pipeline continues with:
- **[Embeddings Service](<YOUR_EMBEDDINGS_SERVICE_GITHUB_LINK>)** – Consumes messages from the chunking topic, generates vector embeddings, and publishes them to the **embeddings topic**.
- **[Ingestion Service](<YOUR_INGESTION_SERVICE_GITHUB_LINK>)** – Consumes embeddings messages and inserts processed data into **DataStax**.

## Ingestion Flow

[Session Management Service]  -->  Kafka Topic: chunking | v [Embeddings Service]          -->  Kafka Topic: embeddings | v [Ingestion Service]           -->  DataStax Storage

## Notes
- This service **must be executed first** in the MRMG ingestion flow.
- Kafka topics involved:
  - `chunking` – Initiated by this service.
  - `embeddings` – Produced by the Embeddings Service.
  - `ingestion` – Produced by the Ingestion Service.
