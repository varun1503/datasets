ðŸš€ Deployment & Testing

End-to-end integration tested successfully.

Deployed the complete pipeline (RFR + Findings + Ingestion Services) into E1 Production environment.

Verified data flow across Kafka â†’ Chunking â†’ Embedding â†’ Ingestion â†’ DataStax.

Do you want me to make this into a slide format (with bullets & icons) for the sprint review deck, or keep it as a text-only one-pager?
