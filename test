Here are polished, professional, and senior-manager–appropriate versions of both answers:


---

✅ What would you like this leader to keep doing?

“Continue guiding us with clarity and supporting us in delivering high-quality work. I appreciate the open and comfortable environment you create, which encourages honest conversations and collaboration.”


---

✅ What could this leader do differently to be more effective?

“It would be beneficial if you could continue sharing more of your expertise and experience with the team, as it helps us broaden our perspective and improve our overall effectiveness.”

If you want it more formal, shorter, or longer, I can adjust it!
