Description:
This sprint aims to achieve full E2 deployment, establish E3 readiness, and conduct complete end-to-end testing across all major services â€” chunking, embedding, and ingestion. The focus is on validating stable deployments, ensuring configuration consistency, and verifying message flow across Kafka topics and CI/CD pipelines. The goal is to make the system production-ready for E3 by addressing all deployment dependencies, environment variables, and automation gaps.

Acceptance Criteria:
E2 environment is successfully deployed and verified for all services, with all Kafka credentials, ACLs, and environment configurations validated. E3 configurations are prepared, tested, and documented for smooth migration. End-to-end data flow testing confirms reliable communication between services with zero data loss or deployment failure. All regression, integration, and performance tests pass without critical defects, and deployment reports are shared with validation logs confirming E3 readiness.
