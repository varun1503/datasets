Below is a one-stop enhancement to your existing parse_with_merged_cells method that automatically detects any nested tables inside cells and recursively parses them, appending their rows immediately after the parent table’s rows.

Summary

By leveraging python-docx’s built-in ability to see nested tables via _Cell.tables and then recursing into them, we can extend your current merged-cell logic to also pull out every inner table. The updated method will:

1. First do exactly what you have today—respect vertical merges and build parsed_rows.


2. Then walk each cell for any cell.tables, and for each nested table, call parse_with_merged_cells again.


3. Append each nested table’s parsed rows into the same output list (you can easily adjust this if you’d rather return them separately).



This way, you get a flat list of all rows in document order—outer table rows followed by each nested table’s rows.

Detecting Nested Tables in python-docx

In python-docx, every <w:tc> (table cell) exposes a .tables sequence of any <w:tbl> elements inside it; nested tables are not in the document’s top-level .tables list but accessible through these cell objects . A common StackOverflow snippet shows how to recurse:

def iter_tables_within_table(table):
    for row in table.rows:
        for cell in row.cells:
            for nested in cell.tables:
                yield nested
                yield from iter_tables_within_table(nested)

Updated parse_with_merged_cells with Nested-Table Support

from docx.table import Table as DocxTable

def parse_with_merged_cells(self, table: DocxTable):
    """
    Parse 'table' honoring vertical merges, then detect any nested tables
    and append their rows recursively.
    """
    parsed_rows = []
    # --- Stage 1: Handle merged cells as before ---
    for row in table.rows:
        row_data = []
        for col_idx, cell in enumerate(row.cells):
            tc = cell._tc
            tcPr = tc.tcPr
            vmerge = tcPr.vMerge if tcPr is not None and tcPr.vMerge is not None else None

            if vmerge is not None:
                # continue or restart merged cells
                if vmerge.val is None or vmerge.val == 'continue':
                    row_data.append(self.merged_cells_tracker.get(col_idx, ""))
                else:  # 'restart'
                    cell_text = self.get_cell_text(cell)
                    self.merged_cells_tracker[col_idx] = cell_text
                    row_data.append(cell_text)
            else:
                cell_text = self.get_cell_text(cell)
                self.merged_cells_tracker[col_idx] = cell_text
                row_data.append(cell_text)

        # skip fully blank rows
        if any(cell.strip() for cell in row_data):
            parsed_rows.append(row_data)

    # --- Stage 2: Detect & parse nested tables inside every cell ---
    for row in table.rows:
        for cell in row.cells:
            # each .tables is a list of nested DocxTable objects
            for nested_tbl in cell.tables:
                # recurse to parse merged/nested behavior
                nested_rows = self.parse_with_merged_cells(nested_tbl)
                # append with an optional marker or directly
                parsed_rows.extend(nested_rows)

    return parsed_rows

Key points

cell.tables gives you any inner tables in that cell .

Recursion via self.parse_with_merged_cells(nested_tbl) ensures nested merges also get respected.

You end up with a single list where outer rows appear first, then all nested tables’ rows—maintaining document order .
