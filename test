ðŸ§¾ Sprint Summary â€“ Parsing & Ingestion Enhancements

I enhanced the parsing service to support Word document ingestion, including handling of tables, image captions, and associated formatting styles.

I implemented and tested logic for detecting and parsing merged tables across multiple document formats to ensure robustness and accuracy.

I integrated these improvements into the existing DataLoader pipeline and updated the API layer to support ingestion via S3.

I extended the parsing logic to extract styling attributes for each wordâ€”such as font, boldness, and sizeâ€”and included this metadata in the CSV export.

I refactored the chunking module to support both "no chunking" mode and the AutoMergeChunker, which now uses the NLTK splitter for more natural text segmentation.

After parsing, I ensured the final output is correctly formatted into CSV for seamless ingestion into the DataStax API.
