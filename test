I noticed that the sample RFR document currently has some inconsistencies in its formatting. In several cases, when a bracket is opened, it is not properly closed, which requires handling multiple edge cases in the logic.

I've updated the implementation so that the output is now consistent. Going forward, could you please ensure that the RFR documents follow a consistent and standard format? I've also attached a corrected sample document below for reference-kindly use the same format in future documents.

Thanks for your support and understanding.
