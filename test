Hereâ€™s a clean, rephrased version of your three tasks for creating them in a structured way:


---

Task 1: Incorporate RFR and Findings into the Annotation Validation Report

Description:
In the annotation validation report, each section is associated with IMBP questions. These questions often have corresponding findings, and based on those findings, relevant RFR (Request for Response) questions need to be included. This task focuses on ensuring that the findings and RFRs are properly integrated into the annotated validation report under the correct sections.


---

Task 2: Add Fixed Table to the Validation Report Template

Description:
A static reference table needs to be incorporated into the validation report. For this, a predefined (pretend) Word document containing the table is used. The table should be appended seamlessly into the main validation report document, preserving formatting and structure.


---

Task 3: Include Table of Contents, Cover Page, and Findings into the Validation Report

Description:
This task involves enhancing the validation report with a professional structure. The report should begin with a cover page that includes the model ID, model description, and the date of report generation. Following the cover page, a dynamically generated table of contents should be added, covering all headings and subheadings. Afterward, the predefined document (pretend Word doc) should be appended, followed by the findings table and RFR findings, ensuring a logical and consistent flow.

Do you want me to also format these as a JSON/YAML task definition (so you can directly add them into your pipeline/task tracker), or keep them in this descriptive style?
