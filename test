Got it 👍 You want just one detailed point per diagram (a single summary statement that captures what the whole diagram/block does).

Here’s the simplified version:


---

Diagram 1 – ACE Workflow Platform (On-Premise to S3)

📌 Transfers documents from Griffin (Docs Center) through the ACE workflow platform and stores them securely in S3 within the on-prem environment.


---

Diagram 2 – Data Processing API (Hydra-GCP)

📌 Parses PDF files, extracts required information, validates adequacy and accuracy, and processes the file within Hydra on GCP.


---

Diagram 3 – Business Rule & Output Layer (LUMI/GCP)

📌 Applies business rules to extracted data, validates against the database, generates reports, and stores final results in LUMI Data Warehouse on GCP.

Do you want me to also make these short one-liners appear inside the diagram blocks (so each diagram has one central description), or keep them as external notes?
