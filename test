Hi @Manoj Kumar, good afternoon.

I've successfully created the FastAPI and it's working as expected. I also set up the project repository as you suggested. However, I noticed that the lumos-tooling repository already contains code related to recipecli, so I'm currently unable to push my changes there.

Could you please advise on the next steps?

Thanks!

Let me know if you want a more formal or more casual version as well.
