Here is one combined description and one combined acceptance criteria for both tasks together:


---

📌 Combined Description

You developed and enhanced the data processing workflow by creating a mobile data extraction and formatting pipeline that pulls information from RFR using IMTP questions and mapped test text, and automatically generates a structured Findings Excel. Additionally, you fixed a critical bug in the validation report module that caused failures when no findings were present, ensuring the report now handles zero-finding scenarios smoothly and maintains proper formatting.


---

✅ Combined Acceptance Criteria

The system should correctly extract and map all required data from RFR based on IMTP questions, format it into the Findings Excel template without errors, and handle repeated or missing tags gracefully. The workflow must generate a valid validation report even when findings are zero, with correct messaging and complete structure, without any crashes or formatting issues. The overall pipeline should run reliably, maintain consistent outputs, and meet all QA verification checks.
