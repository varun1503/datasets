To detect drift in a text-based BERT model using metrics such as KS Statistics, Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Jensen-Shannon (JS) distance, Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Cosine Similarity, hereâ€™s how you can proceed step by step:


---

1. Understand the Metrics

KS Statistic (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test): Measures the maximum difference between two cumulative distribution functions. It's useful for numerical features or embeddings.

MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy): Measures the difference between distributions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, often used with embeddings.

JS Distance: Measures divergence between two probability distributions. A JS distance close to 0 indicates similarity.

EMD (Earth Mover's Distance): Measures the "work" needed to transform one distribution into another.

Cosine Similarity: Measures similarity between vectors by the cosine of the angle between them. A value close to 1 means high similarity.

2. Generate Embeddings

Use your BERT model to generate embeddings for the reference (training) dataset and the new dataset. These embeddings will be the input to your drift detection methods.

from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

def get_embeddings(texts):
    inputs = tokenizer(texts, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    return outputs.last_hiddenGuidelines for Drift Detection in Text Using BERT

1. Preprocessing

1.1 Prepare the datasets:

Reference dataset (e.g., training data).

New dataset (e.g., incoming or test data).


1.2 Generate embeddings:

Use the BERT model to extract embeddings for both datasets. These embeddings represent the text in a high-dimensional space.



---

2. Select Drift Metrics

Choose one or more metrics to compare the reference and new datasets:

KS Statistic: Compare the distributions of embeddings across features.

MMD: Use to compare the mean difference of embedding distributions.

JS Distance: Compare probability distributions (e.g., softmax probabilities from the model).

EMD: Assess the effort needed to transform one embedding distribution to another.

Cosine Similarity: Compare the similarity of embeddings directly.



---

3. Threshold Setting

3.1 Empirical thresholding:

Compute the metric values between reference and reference (self-comparison) to establish a baseline.

Set thresholds based on acceptable deviation. For instance:

KS Statistic: threshold = 0.05 (low difference indicates similarity).

MMD: Use a threshold obtained from cross-validation.

JS Distance: Values below 0.1 generally indicate minimal drift.

EMD: Set based on embedding scales (e.g., normalized embeddings, threshold < 0.5).

Cosine Similarity: High similarity (> 0.9) is desirable.



3.2 Domain-specific thresholds:

Adjust thresholds based on the criticality of drift for your application.

4. Drift Detection Steps

4.1 Calculate metrics:

Compute the selected metrics for the reference and new dataset embeddings.


4.2 Compare with thresholds:

Compare computed metric values against the set thresholds to detect drift.


4.3 Interpret results:

If the metric exceeds the threshold, drift is likely present.

Investigate which features or dimensions contribute most to the drift.



---

5. Mitigation Actions

Retrain the model: Include the new data to adapt to the drift.

Reevaluate data pipeline: Address potential changes in data collection or preprocessing.

Alert system: Implement alerts for detected drift exceeding critical thresholds.



---

6. Tools and Libraries

Use libraries such as:

SciPy: For KS Statistics.

PyTorch / TensorFlow: To compute embeddings.

Scikit-learn: For JS distance and cosine similarity.

Alibi-detect or Evidently: For advanced drift detection.

7. Example

Python Code for Cosine Similarity and Thresholding:

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

# Reference and new embeddings (shape: [num_samples, embedding_dim])
reference_embeddings = np.random.rand(100, 768)
new_embeddings = np.random.rand(100, 768)

# Calculate cosine similarity
similarities = cosine_similarity(reference_embeddings, new_embeddings)

# Mean similarity
mean_similarity = np.mean(similarities)

# Threshold
threshold = 0.9
if mean_similarity < threshold:
    print("Drift detected!")
else:
    print("No significant drift.")

By following these steps and customizing thresholds based on your data and use case, you can effectively monitor and handle drift in your BERT-based text model.
