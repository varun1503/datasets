Below is a clean, EA-grade one-pager for the Case Assist EA Playbook Continuation tasks shown in your Rally screenshot.
This is aligned to architecture L3, data flow, sequence diagrams, and detailed design and is suitable for CTO / EA review.

Case Assist – EA Playbook Continuation (Architecture & Design)

Objective

Define and document the end-to-end technical architecture, data flow, sequence interactions, and detailed component design for the Case Assist platform to enable consistent implementation and future scalability.


---

Scope of Work

1. End-to-End Data Flow Diagrams

Create end-to-end data flow diagrams illustrating how data moves across the Case Assist system.

Cover major flows:

Document ingestion

Annotation and structuring

Retrieval and orchestration

Model inference and response generation


Clearly identify:

Data sources and sinks

Persistent vs transient data

Transformation stages




---

2. Sequence Diagrams (3–5 Core Flows)

Create detailed sequence diagrams for key Case Assist use cases.

Illustrate:

Control flow across UI, APIs, orchestration, services, and data stores

Request–response interactions

Error and retry paths


Ensure alignment with data flow diagrams and L3 architecture.



---

3. Detailed Design Document (DDD)

Produce a Detailed Design Document covering:

Component-level design

Class and module responsibilities

LangGraph orchestration nodes and transitions


Define clear interfaces between components to support parallel development.



---

4. Full-Stack Infrastructure & API Design

Document full-stack infrastructure design, including:

Compute, storage, networking, and security components

Environment separation (Dev / Event / Prod)


Provide detailed API reference:

Endpoint definitions

Request/response schemas

Error handling and validation rules




---

Key Deliverables

End-to-end Data Flow Diagrams

3–5 Detailed Sequence Diagrams

Detailed Design Document (Component Level)

Infrastructure Architecture Documentation

API Reference (implementation-ready)



---

Success Criteria

Architecture is L3 compliant and EA-approved

Diagrams are consistent across architecture, data flow, and sequence views

Design is implementation-ready with no ambiguity

Documentation can be directly reused by development teams



---

Dependencies

Finalized Case Assist functional scope

Alignment with existing platform standards

Access to current deployment and orchestration patterns
