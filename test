Slide 1: MDK Overview
MDK: Machine Learning Development Kit

Supports Two Model Types:
Image Models
Text Models
Three Core Services:

Hyperparameter Tuning (HPT):

Tools: Optuna + Dask for efficient and scalable optimization.
Model Interpretation:

Tools: LIME, SHAP, Captum for understanding predictions.
Drift Detection:

Tools: Alibi framework with KS, MMD, Cosine Distance, and EMD.
Slide 2: MDK Highlights
1. Hyperparameter Tuning (HPT):

Combines Optuna (optimization) with Dask (parallel processing) for robust and scalable tuning.
2. Model Interpretation:

Explains predictions using:
LIME: Local interpretability.
SHAP: Feature importance.
Captum: Deep learning interpretability.
3. Drift Detection:

Detects data shifts using Alibi framework with advanced metrics:
KS, MMD, Cosine Distance, EMD.
