📝 Story Description

Update the DOCX caption processing logic to correctly renumber table and figure captions in sequence. The logic should ensure captions are identified accurately, moved above the corresponding table or figure when required, and handle corner cases where footnotes or descriptive text appear near tables or images.


---

✅ Acceptance Criteria

Only valid table and figure captions are detected and renumbered sequentially, captions are correctly positioned above their respective tables or figures, and footnotes, notes, or descriptive paragraphs are excluded from caption processing and remain unchanged.
