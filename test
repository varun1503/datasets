Absolutely! Here's a clearer and more structured rephrased version of your original prompt, while preserving the intent and output format you want:

âœ… Rephrased Prompt

> Using the provided nodes and edges as context, generate a detailed answer to the query. Include the answer and the relevant nodes involved.

After the answer, insert the delimiter "<1>".

Then return a filtered version of the triplet_dict (in str(dict) format), which contains only those triplets that were actually used in generating the answer.

Important: In the values of the triplet dictionary, do not include UUIDs or any unnecessary metadata â€” keep only meaningful content (subject, predicate, object).

ðŸ“Œ Result Format Example

<Answer based on nodes and edges>
<1>
<Filtered triplet_dict as stringified Python dict>

Let me know if you'd like a variant for OpenAI, LangChain, or internal docstring usage too.
