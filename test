Here‚Äôs the Sprint Review one-pager version ‚Äî structured with task headings and bullet points, concise yet professional:

üßæ Sprint Review ‚Äî Validation Report Annotation Automation

Task 1 ‚Äî Annotation Report Template Creation

Developed a core function to automatically generate the Validation Report Template.

The function accepts the model document as a source, a predefined report template, and a CSV mapping file linking sections to questions.

After execution, it produces a structured document containing the Table of Contents, all main sections and subsections, and embedded tables.

Each section includes placeholders for Modeling Team Responses, ensuring the base report is fully structured and ready for further annotation.



---

Task 2 ‚Äî Append Finding Details

Implemented logic to consolidate all findings under a single section titled ‚ÄúFinding Details.‚Äù

Each finding block includes three key components ‚Äî Challenge, Modeling Team Response, and MRMG Assessment.

Ensured consistent formatting, clear separation of content, and logical ordering of findings.

This enhancement allows reviewers to view all relevant information in one place without overlapping with model-specific sections like S1 or S2.



---

Task 3 ‚Äî MRMG Response Generation

Automated the creation of MRMG Response blocks for every test question in the report.

Each MRMG Response appears immediately after its corresponding Modeling Team Response, maintaining logical flow and readability.

The system cross-references related Findings and RFRs, automatically mentioning them within the MRMG section.

This integration provides a comprehensive view linking the model‚Äôs input with MRMG‚Äôs validation commentary.



---

Task 4 ‚Äî Document Formatting and Finalization

Standardized the heading hierarchy across the report (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.1.1) to ensure proper structural flow.

Applied uniform text formatting, fonts, and paragraph spacing aligned with MRMG document standards.

Regenerated and aligned the Table of Contents to reflect accurate page references.

Produced a clean, professional, and submission-ready Validation Report requiring no manual post-processing.



---

Overall Outcome

Delivered a fully automated, end-to-end pipeline that converts raw model documentation into a complete, formatted Validation Report.

The solution now supports dynamic inclusion of Findings, RFRs, and MRMG feedback while preserving structure, style, and consistency.

This automation significantly reduces manual effort and ensures accuracy and standardization across all MRMG validation deliverables.

Would you like me to format this into a single-slide PPT one-pager with icons and layout (for sprint presentation)?

Task 4 ‚Äî Heading Numbering & Text Reformatting (Finalize Document)

Goal: Normalize heading numbering, text formatting, and overall document style, producing the final, submission-ready Validation Report.

Scope:

Ensure all headings carry the correct number (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.1.1) consistent with the template hierarchy.

Reformat text (fonts, sizes, spacing, list levels) to template styles.

Preserve figure/table captions; do not renumber model tables beyond template rules.


Acceptance Criteria:

All headings display correct numbers and levels, consistent across the doc.

Body text adheres to template styles (font family/size, line spacing, paragraph spacing).

Lists render correctly (no broken numbering, no mixed bullet styles).

TOC regenerates with correct page numbers and heading labels.

No style regressions in tables (column widths, merged cells intact).

The final DOCX opens without repair prompts and passes a quick manual scan for layout issues (no overflow beyond page margins).

Notes & Dependencies

T2 depends on the base doc from T1.

T3 depends on the structured sections/questions from T1 and any mapping to findings/RFR.

T4 runs last to unify numbering/styles across all injected content.

Consider adding small CLI wrappers for each task for pipeline CI runs.


If you want, I can also turn these into Jira tickets with concise descriptions and checklists.
