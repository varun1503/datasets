Sprint Work Completed – MRMG Integration Pipeline:

1. Kafka Integration with Indexing Pipeline:

Configured and validated the Kafka setup for the MRMG indexing pipeline.

Successfully ran the end-to-end pipeline locally before deploying it on the E1 environment.



2. Development of Chunking Service:

Built a robust chunking service capable of parsing Word .docx files.

Integrated data preprocessing and the AutoMerger-based dynamic chunking logic.

Enabled Kafka-based message publishing of the ready chunks to downstream embedding and ingestion services.



3. Multithreading for Image Processing:

Implemented multithreading logic to efficiently process images within Word documents.

Significantly reduced the ingestion time by parallelizing image handling.

Refactored the ingestion service to integrate with MRMG’s Datastax-based pipeline and ensured compatibility.



4. End-to-End Service Testing in E1:

Conducted comprehensive testing of all three services—chunking, embedding, and ingestion—within the E1 environment.

Verified functionality under MRMG’s session management framework to ensure seamless integration and stability.
